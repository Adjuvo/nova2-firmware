# Nova2 Firmware
Online Repository that contains official firmware binaries for the Nova 2.0 Haptic Glove.

There is currently no official way for one to upload firmware binaries manually to the Nova 2.0 Glove. As such, we recommend to update your Nova 2.0 glove(s) via [the SenseCom software](https://github.com/Adjuvo/SenseCom) when that functionality becomes available.
